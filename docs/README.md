# Introduction to Diamante Documentation

Diamante is a layer-1 open-source, decentralized, peer-to-peer blockchain network that provides developers with a robust framework for creating decentralized applications, asset issuance, and seamless connection to existing financial infrastructures. The network is designed to enable creators, innovators, and developers to facilitate the development of interoperating projects.
