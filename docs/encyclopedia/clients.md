# Clients

The Diamante network can be accessed through the Aurora API. Aurora acts as the bridge between your application and the Diamante network. It provides endpoints to submit transactions, check the status of accounts, and query historical data.

## Testnet Aurora Client

When developing and testing your application, you should use the Testnet Aurora client. This client interacts with the Testnet network, which is a separate Diamante network used for testing. It has the same functionality as the Mainnet, but the DIAM used on it have no value.

## Mainnet Aurora Client

Once your application is ready for production, you should switch to the Mainnet Aurora client. This client interacts with the Mainnet network, where real value is transferred.
