# Inflation

The inflation operation is deprecated. Here’s why:

Before Protocol 12, DIamante had a built-in inflation mechanism designed to allow account holders to collectively direct inflation-generated DIAMs toward projects built on Diamante.

As the network evolved and grew, it became clear that inflation wasn’t working as intended — account holders either didn’t set their inflation destination or joined inflation pools to claim the inflation themselves. The operational costs associated with inflation payments continued to rise, and so DAP-26, a protocol change to disable inflation, was proposed, implemented, voted on by validators, and ultimately adopted as part of a network upgrade.
